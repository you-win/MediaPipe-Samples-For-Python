# Work notes idk
Refer to [cpp/python](https://claytonrichey.com/post/c-cpp-python-pipe/) pipes for inter-process communication.

Setup something similiar for Godot Rust

1. Get demo.cc compiling with mediapipe holistic + iris (`process_frame()` is a good place to refer to)
2. Setup a rust GDNative extension to read from the mediapipe os pipe (refer to python file for implementation tips? maybe?)
3. ???
4. Profit
